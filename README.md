# Olectio Converter

The purpose of this R&D project is to explore the technological limits of converting PDF files to HTML5 while extracting and optimizing all the information contained in the PDF. The project will be developed entirely in Typescript including the PDF analysis and data extraction at a binary level.

The project will involve researching and implementing various algorithms and techniques for extracting data from PDF files, including text, images, and other multimedia elements. The extracted data will then be optimized and formatted for display in HTML5 format, with a focus on maximizing the speed and efficiency of the conversion process.

The project will also involve extensive testing to ensure that the converted HTML5 files are accurate and complete, with all relevant data properly formatted and displayed. The testing will be performed using a variety of PDF files of varying complexity and size, and will involve both manual and automated testing methods.

The final output of the project will be a high-quality PDF-to-HTML5 conversion tool that can be used by developers and businesses to streamline their document conversion workflows. The tool will be designed to be highly customizable, with a range of options for optimizing the conversion process and output format.

Overall, this project represents an exciting opportunity to push the boundaries of PDF-to-HTML5 conversion technology, while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Typescript programming language.
